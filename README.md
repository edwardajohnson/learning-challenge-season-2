# My Daily learning: 

## July 1 - Building up my information areas and coding areas for the challenge
- I want tp use my Capstone project as a basis for revising many of the ML concepts that I have already learned.
- The Capstone is based on the City of Toronto Parking Ticket violation dataset

## July 2 - Building up my information areas and coding areas for week 1 
- I set up the key areas to work through during the next week in addition to the basics
- Basis will be the Queen St parking tickets dataset
- Geolocation
- Time Series 

## July 4 - Building a blockchain in Python
